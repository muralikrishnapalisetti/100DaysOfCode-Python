# 🧩 Day 5 – Reeborg's World Maze Solver

Today I completed a super fun logic challenge using **Reeborg’s World**!


## 🤖 What I Did

Helped a robot navigate through a maze using a classic **right-hand wall-following algorithm**.


## 🧠 Concepts Practiced

- `while` loops
- `if-elif-else` control flow
- Writing clean, reusable functions (`turn_right()`)
- Algorithmic thinking and strategy


## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Platform**: [Reeborg’s World](https://reeborg.ca)
- **World**: Maze
- **Language**: Python (Reeborg's custom interpreter)


## 💡 Key Learning

> You don’t always need complex logic to solve complex problems — clarity and consistency matter most.


## 🔁 Algorithm Used

**Right-hand rule**: Always keep your right hand on the wall, and you'll eventually escape. Works surprisingly well in any maze.


## 🔗 Try It Yourself

Head to [reeborg.ca](https://reeborg.ca)  
1. Select **"Maze"** world  
2. Paste the code from `maze_solver.py`  
3. Run the program!
