# 🎮 Day 6 – Hangman Game in Python

Today I built the classic **Hangman Game** using Python!

A fun word guessing game where you try to guess the secret word one letter at a time. Every wrong guess draws part of the hangman. Guess the word before you run out of lives!

---

## 🧠 What I Practiced

- **Indentation** for clean and readable code ✍️
- **For loops** for efficient character replacement 🔄
- **String handling** for managing user input 🧑‍💻
- **Game logic** to track guesses, lives, and win/lose conditions 🏆
- **ASCII Art** to show progress visually 🎨

---

## 🔧 Tools & Concepts

- `random.choice()` to select a secret word
- ASCII visual stages to show the Hangman
- Tracking guessed letters and remaining lives
- `if-elif-else` decision structures
- `for` loops with indexing

---

## 💡 Key Takeaway

> A simple project like Hangman brings together logic, loops, string handling, and visual feedback. It’s a fun way to think through code like a real developer.

---

## ✅ How to Play

1. Run the script
2. Enter one letter per turn
3. Don’t repeat wrong guesses
4. Win by guessing the word before the Hangman is fully drawn

## 📦 Word List

Includes words like:
- apple
- banana
- monkey
- krishna
- television
- ironman, batman, superman

these are the are sample words i added.
