# 🎯 Day 3 – Rock, Paper, Scissors Game 🪨📄✂️

Welcome to Day 3 of my #100DaysOfCode Python Projects Challenge!

Today’s project is a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game, where you play against the computer in a race to 3 points. The game includes fun ASCII art, input handling, and score tracking.

## 🔧 What I Built

- A best-of-3 Rock, Paper, Scissors game in the console.
- Player and computer make choices using numbers.
- Tracks wins and displays celebratory or defeat messages with ASCII art.


## 🧠 Concepts I Practiced

- Lists and multi-line strings (ASCII art 🎨)
- Random number generation with `random.randint()`
- `while` loops and `if-else` conditionals for game logic
- Functions and recursion for replay feature
- Input validation and error handling with `try-except`

## 📌 Why It Was Fun

This project combined creativity and logic. The addition of ASCII art and scoring made it more engaging than a basic RPS game. It's a great way to learn loops, conditions, and function structure!
