## Day 2 â€“ Treasure Hunt: Riddle Run

ðŸ’¡ A riddle-filled treasure hunt game where every choice matters! Solve tricky riddles, avoid traps, and race to uncover the hidden treasure. With only 3 lives, every decision could be your last!

##  What I Built:
- Interactive text-based game
- ASCII art and adventure logic
- Player decision system

##  Concepts I Practiced:
- `while` loops for game flow and life tracking
- `if-else` statements for choice outcomes
- `input()` and `print()` for interactivity
- ASCII art and visual formatting

##  Why It Was Fun:
Combining logic and creativity made this game super engaging. Itâ€™s a fun way to practice conditionals and loops while building a playable story!
