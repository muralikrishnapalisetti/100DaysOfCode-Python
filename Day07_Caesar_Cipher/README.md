# 🚀 Day 7 – Caesar Cipher in Python 🔐

Today, I built a classic **Caesar Cipher** program that can **encode** and **decode** secret messages by shifting letters in the alphabet.

## What is Caesar Cipher?

A simple encryption technique where each letter in the message is shifted by a fixed number of positions.  
Example: Shifting "A" by 3 becomes "D".

## Features

- Encode (encrypt) or decode (decrypt) messages  
- Supports lowercase letters only  
- Non-alphabet characters (spaces, numbers, symbols) remain unchanged  
- Handles shift values greater than 26 by wrapping around  

---

## What I Learned

- Writing reusable functions with inputs and outputs  
- Handling user inputs and validations  
- Using modular arithmetic to wrap shifts around the alphabet  
- Differences between positional and keyword arguments in functions

## How to Use

1. Run the program  
2. Choose to encode or decode  
3. Enter the message  
4. Enter the shift number  
5. Get the encoded or decoded message  
6. Repeat or exit as you wish
