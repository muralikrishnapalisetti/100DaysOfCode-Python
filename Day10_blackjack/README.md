# 🃏 Day 10 – Blackjack Game in Python

Welcome to Day 10 of my **#100DaysOfPython** challenge!  
Today, I built an exciting **Blackjack game** in Python – a card game where you play against the dealer and try to get a hand value of 21 without going over.

## 🎮 What It Does

- Simulates a real Blackjack game.
- Handles user and dealer turns.
- Implements Blackjack rules:
  - Ace can be 11 or 1.
  - 10s cover J, Q, K.
  - Dealer draws until reaching 17 or higher.
  - Player can hit or stand.
- Compares hands and declares the result (win/lose/draw).

## 📌 Features Used

- Python functions and return values
- `if-else` conditionals and loops
- Lists to manage cards in hand
- `random.choice()` to simulate card drawing
- Game replay loop for continuous play

## 🧠 Skills Gained

- Game logic and flow control
- Working with return values and conditionals
- Handling game state and edge cases (like Ace switching from 11 to 1)

## 🖥️ How to Play

Just run the Python script. You’ll be prompted to:
- Draw cards (`y`) or stop (`n`)
- See your hand vs the dealer
- Replay the game if you wish!
