# 📅 Day 9 – PyCalculator 🧮

I just wrapped up **Day 9** of my #100DaysOfCode challenge with a fun and functional **Python Calculator!** 🧠  
This project helped me apply **functions**, **loops**, **user input**, and **function mapping** in a real way.

## 🧪 What I Learned:

✅ **Functions with Outputs**  
Functions can return results that can be used later in calculations — not just perform actions!

✅ **Multiple Return Values**  
Although not used today, I explored the idea that functions can return more than one value, which is powerful for future use.

✅ **Docstrings**  
Adding quick explanations using `"""triple quotes"""` inside functions for better readability and documentation.

✅ **Keyboard Shortcut**  
Discovered the time-saving `Ctrl + /` shortcut to **comment/uncomment code instantly**!

## 🚀 Project Features:

- Performs **basic arithmetic**: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division  
- Uses a **dictionary of operations** to call the correct function dynamically  
- Allows **chaining calculations** without restarting  
- Offers an option to **restart** after finishing one set of calculations  
- Fun and professional **ASCII UI** to simulate a calculator

## 📁 File:

- `calculator.py` – Main file with all the logic

## ✨ Motivation:
"Tiny efforts every day can lead to huge results over time."
