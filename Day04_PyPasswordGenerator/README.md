# 🔐 Day 4 – PyPassword Generator

Welcome to Day 4 of my #100DaysOfCode challenge!

Today I created a **random password generator** using Python. This tool creates strong passwords based on user input, ensuring both randomness and complexity.


## 🔧 What I Built

A console-based password generator where users can define:
- Number of letters (uppercase & lowercase)
- Number of symbols
- Number of digits

## 🧠 Concepts I Practiced

- `for` loops for repeated selection
- Python lists and list comprehension
- `random` module (`choice`, `shuffle`)
- String and list manipulation



## 🎉 Why It’s Useful

It’s a quick and secure way to generate passwords without depending on online tools. It gave me practice with randomness, user input, and basic security principles.

💬 **Challenge for You**: Can you make this generator create multiple passwords at once?

### 🚀 Run It Yourself

```bash
python password_generator.py
